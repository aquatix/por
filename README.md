Por (Dutch for 'nudge') is a service that reminds you of periodic tasks if it doesn't get (automatically) notified by the job being done. It's not the same as a todo list (it can be used as such), but more as a way to ensure things aren't missed (think about your backups, sending in periodic correspondention, cancelling a service in a few years).
